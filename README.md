# Ubuntu Catnip
Catnip for Ubuntu. Boost imagination, playfullness, and curiosity with command line utilities, easter eggs, programs, games, and a nice Desktop environment based off of i3. Radically different from the other i3 rices because it is a floating window system by default, however one could press CTRL+Y to make each window tiled on-the-fly. Also, press MOD+Q or MOD+MiddleClick (on title bar) to quit a program. And, of course, right click-and-drag to resize a window. Uses XFCE4's panel instead of the i3 bar.
Install by running runme.sh in root by: "sudo bash runme.sh"
